# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
    Challnege 15

## Porpuse

The porpuse of this project is:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


## Delivery 1: suspension coil summary statistics

For the analysis of deliverable 1 analysis, we worked with the following data:

We need to obtain the next information

The variable that has the enganchen is the length of the vehicle

The graph shows the relationship between the variables vehicle length and mpg

From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 70% of the variablilty of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model.


## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

For this delivery, the information table used is shown

In this image we can apreciate the important values

Variance <= 100

The maximum standard deviation has been determined to be 10, so it is important to determine the amount of data that exceeds that limit.

## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils

In the following deliverable it is important to apply a T-testis one of the most basic and popular statistical tests in the world

In the following deliverable it is important to apply a T-testis one of the most basic and popular statistical tests in the world, considering that the p value is the probability that an event occurs and this defined p.value > 0.05, it is a reference value that we will be using.

In the three t tests carried out, it can be seen that in lot 1 and lot 2 the pvalue is very similar, but in lot 3, the data is very different


## Deliverable 4:
### Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

It is important to keep in mind that the points to analyze can be too many to have a complete study.
The points that we must take into account is the environment where we are going to develop this study.
The type or potential buyers by type of vehicle
The cultural environment in which they develop
The social stratum to which they belong to determine who may or may not be interested in the vehicles.

Hypotesis

The environment in which they develop is a determining factor in choosing the type of vehicle they will buy.
The social stratum to which they belong will give them choice options when purchasing a vehicle.
The type of economy in which they operate will mark the decision to purchase a vehicle.

Type of economy: if it is an urban or rural area


To develop our hypothesis it is important:
* Determine the important points to be analyzed.
* Define the information we will need to accept or deny our hypotheses.
* Through the assumptions that we want to analyze, the information must be categorized and must come from a reliable source.
* How we will obtain this information, through a survey or a search of established databases.

* What metric or metrics are you going to test?
* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
* What data is needed to run the statistical test?
