# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
    Challnege 15

## Porpuse

The porpuse of this project is:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


## Delivery 1: suspension coil summary statistics

For the analysis of deliverable 1 analysis, we worked with the following data:

We need to obtain the next information

The graph shows the relationship between the variables vehicle length and mpg


## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis




## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils




## Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
